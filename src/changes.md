## 1.3 Latest changes

Sadata version 2, released in June 2021, introduces the following new features

### Frameworks and SDS

To integrate Samoa's national objectives as specified in its [Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS) â†—](https://www.mof.gov.ws/services/aid-coordination-debt-management/strategy-for-the-development-of-samoa), a flexible **framework** concept was introduced where multiple types of obligations and objectives can be looked at together or independently.

In addition to the previously existing international implementation frameworks "Human Rights Recommendations" and "Sustainable Development Goals", the SDS were thus introduced as a third, national implementation framework.

>
> [3.2 Explore: Frameworks](visitors/frameworks.md)

### Nested categories and convention articles

To reflect the three-level hierarchy of the SDS, the IMPACT OSS's concept of nested categories was integrated where categories of a (secondary) taxonomy can become sub-categories of categories of another (principal) taxonomy.

With the 54 **Strategic Outcomes** of the SDS considered to be the objectives of the SDS framework, the 14 **SDS Key Outcomes** that group them could be configured as nested sub-categories of the 4 principal **SDS Priority Area** categories.

This also allowed to better reflect the periodic nature of the Human Rights Recommendations, where the **Reporting cycles** are treated as sub-categories of the **Human rights bodies**.

The different **human rights convention articles** that were previously added to Sadata to complement the periodic recommendations, are now also classified using a special "Reporting cycle" sub-category "Articles" nested under each of the Human rights bodies.

In addition a new taxonomy "Sources" was introduced to allow differentiating the HR objectives with the following categories:

* Human Rights Conventions articles
* International recommendations
* National recommendations
