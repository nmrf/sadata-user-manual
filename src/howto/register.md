_It is important to note that simply registering as described above only allows the user to contribute draft progress reports to indicators as a [Guest Contributor](../howto/reporting-and-follow-up.md). To publish and edit other information, specific user permission rights have to be granted by an Administrator or Manager. [Click here](../members/users-admin.md) for more details_
