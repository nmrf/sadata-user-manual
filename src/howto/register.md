\*\* _It is important to note that simply registering as described above only allows the user to contribute draft progress reports to indicators as a _[_Guest Contributor_](howto/reporting-and-follow-up.md)_. To publish and edit other information, specific user permission rights have to be granted by an Administrator or Manager. _[_Click here _](members/users-admin.md)_for more details \*\*_
