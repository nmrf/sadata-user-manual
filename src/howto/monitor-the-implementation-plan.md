### 2.3 How to: Monitor the Implementation Plan

The monitoring of the implementation plan is crucial for both the State and civil society. It tells both when progress is falling behind what it should be and where that is happening. The tool makes it easy and simple to quickly check progress of the whole plan, or any part of the plan which may be of interest to the user.

To view the human rights Implementation Plan and start monitoring click on  'Actions' in the top menu bar and then select 'Implementation view'. \(To view the SDG Implementation Plan click on 'SDG Targets' and make the same selection.\)

Clicking on this link will provide you with the Implementation Plan:

1. The Implementation Plan is automatically organised by thematic cluster. In the example above we are looking at the 'Human rights training for law enforcement officials' thematic cluster. Clicking on this title would bring up all of the recommendations contained within the cluster.

2. Underneath each cluster you will first see the actions that are being undertaken to achieve the goals and recommendations of that cluster. The tags underneath the action \(e.g. HR Training, AGO\) indicate the categories the action is tagged with - in the first example Human Rights training as the issue and the Office of the Attorney general as the implementing agency. Clicking on the action will bring up full details.

3. Alongside the actions are the indicators associated with that action. There may be one or more indicator for each action. Clicking on the indicator will bring up the full details.

4. The progress reports column  shows any data \(contained within a progress report\) that has been uploaded against any indicator, when the next progress report is due and if any are overdue. This allows the viewer to scroll down and quickly see where information is overdue and the State can then take corrective action or civil society can raise questions as to why that is. The information that appears here will also be mostly visible to the public so civil society and other stakeholders can access the information just by clicking on the link \(in the above example where it says 'Guest report'. Unless there is sensitive information States are encouraged to make all progress reports publicly available for improved transparency and accountability.

5. The State, civil society or other stakeholders can use the filters and search box to focus on parts of the Implementation Plan, depending on their area of interest. For instance, if an NGO just wanted to look at parts of the plan relating to persons with disability they could click on the 'affected persons' link in the left hand menu bar and select that demographic. The implementation plan would then just show the parts affecting persons with disability.

Monitoring the implementation plan is therefore simply a case of:

i. scrolling down the list of thematic clusters to see where progress reports are overdue; or

ii. clicking on progress reports to check data; or

iii. using the filtering and search functions to look into any section of the implementation plan and identify overdue progress reports or analyse information already submitted as per points \(i\) and \(ii\).
