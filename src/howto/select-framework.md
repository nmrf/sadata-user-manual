## 2.1 Select a framework (NEW)

Sadata can be used in single- or multi-framework-mode, allowing the user to focus on either one implementation framework at a time or -for an integrated view- all of the frameworks at once.

You can select a single framework at the bottom of the start page or using the dropdown on the left of the menu bar. For all frameworks select "(Explore) all frameworks".
