## 1.1 What is Sadata?

### The Problem

Each State around the world has a huge range of international and national obligations and objectives with regards to human rights and sustainable development. Many of these obligations and objectives overlap, meaning that for example one of the SDG targets may be asking a State to do the same thing as one of its UPR recommendations. [Sadata ↗](https://sadata.ws) was developed to help identify all of those linkages and eliminate the duplication of activities and reporting that can occur as a result.

### The Solution

[Sadata ↗](https://sadata.ws) is a web tool for coordinating and monitoring implementation of human rights and the SDGs. It helps States develop a National Implementation Plan through sophisticated clustering of all obligations and recommendations it has received. Through a series of automated processes it helps to ensure ongoing data collection and guard against non-entry of data, meaning the Implementation Plan progress is always 100% up to date. This allows greater oversight by the public and civil society, and for States to have far greater control over implementation of its obligations - ultimately leading to more effective State implementation and reporting and improvements on the ground for everyday people, every day.

### The Technology

Sadata is built using [IMPACT OSS ↗](https://impactoss.org/impactoss/) \(**I**ntegrated **M**anagement and **P**lanning of **Act**ions **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware\). For more information on this software and how it was made please take a look at its development history in the next chapter [History](history.md).

### The Users

Sadata is a primarily a tool for States to plan and monitor implementation of its human rights and sustainable development obligations. However, it has also been built with a wider audience in mind whereby civil society and other stakeholders can access the publicly available database and track progress, holding Government to account and contributing their own data where appropriate.

### This User Manual

#### Content

This manual is split into four parts, with the following three chapters following this introduction:

> [**3. In Depth: Visitors**](visitors/using-as-a-visitor.md) - Everything visitors to the site need to know about how to use the tool from monitoring the implementation plan, to using the filtering system to find what the Government is doing in their area of interest to submitting information of their own.

> [**4. In Depth: Registered Users**](members/user-roles.md) - Everything States need to know in how to use and setup the application. This section also details the different types of registered user and how they can perform their roles.
