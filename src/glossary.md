### General

#### National Implementation Plan

The National Implementation Plan consists of the obligations of the State in relation to human rights and the SDGs. It also contains the actions the Government is planning to do to implement those obligations and contains the data of progress achieved to date.

#### National Mechanism for Implementation, Reporting and Follow-Up

Government body responsible for coordinating all human rights implementation and reporting. May also contain representatives from civil society, NHRIs, judiciary, Parliamentarians, private sector

### User roles

Please see [4.1. User roles & responsibilities](members/user-roles.md) for more details.

#### Role: Visitor

Any member of the public visiting the site.

#### Role: Guest

A registered user implicitly assumes the role "Guest", allowing them to bookmark views and contribute progress data.

NGOs, NHRIs or any member of the public can contribute data as a **Guest Contributor** to show progress towards any part of the National Implementation Plan or SDGs. This gives groups and individuals a platform to showcase their work to Government and to encourage more coordinated activities.

#### Role: Contributor

A user promoted to "Contributor". As the data owner for an indicator the user can be assigned to that indicator and become an **Indicator Manager**. A user can be promoted to Contributor and/or be assigned an Indicator Manager by either a Manager or Administrator (see below)

#### Role: Manager

A user promoted to "Manager" can become a

* **Category Manager** responsible for an area of the National Implementation Plan (e.g. UPR recommendations, CRC recommendations, SDG targets, etc.),
* **Implementation Plan Manager** responsible for developing and updating the National Implementation Plan.

#### Role: Administrator

A user promoted to "Administrator" can be responsible for

* editorial content,
* managing other Users, including Managers,
* the application overall.

### Principal Implementation Plan Entities

#### Frameworks

A framework is a set of objectives.

Sadata currently includes the following three implementation frameworks (see below for framework objectives):

* Human Rights
* Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS)
* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

---

#### Objectives

An objective can be anything that can be targeted by actions and can include recommendations, observations, articles and goals. All objectives are entered into the application and are clustered to form the basis of an integrated National Implementation Plan.

Learn more: [for visitors (3.6)](visitors/objectives.md) | [for registered users (4.6)](members/objectives.md)

The objectives for each of the three frameworks are:

##### Human Rights Recommendations (framework: Human Rights)

![](assets/recommendations_icon.png) ![Accepted](assets/recAccepted_icon.png) ![Not_accepted](assets/recNotAccepted_icon.png)  
_Recommendation | Accepted | Not accepted_

HR recommendations include

* international recommendations and observations, received from the Universal Periodic Review, the treaty body committees and the Special Procedures
* national recommendations
* convention articles

##### SDS Strategic Outcomes (framework: SDS)

_TODO @dmprk: provide icon_

The SDS Strategic Outcomes are the targets set out in the SDS.

##### SDG Targets (framework: SDGs)

![](assets/7_sdgs.png)

One or more SDG Targets have been defined for each **Sustainable Development Goal** (SDG, see below).

---

#### Actions

![](assets/actions_icon.png)

Actions are what the State says it is going to do to address **Thematic Clusters** (see below) of **Objectives** and implement those obligations

Learn more: [for visitors (3.4)](visitors/actions.md) | [for registered users (4.4)](members/actions.md)

---

#### Indicators

![](assets/indicators_icon.png)

For each **Action** there should be at least one indicator, which describes how the success of that **Action** will be measured. Indicators have also been defined for **SDG Targets** and can be set up for all objectives.

Learn more: [for visitors (3.5)](visitors/indicators.md) | [for registered users (4.5)](members/indicators.md)

---

#### Progress reports

![](assets/report_icon.png)

When an **Indicator** is created within the application a date is set for when the information/data is due. This could be a one off or an ongoing process (e.g. quarterly crime statistics). When information is due the Indicator Owner will receive an automate email to upload the required data. This is called a progress report.

### Taxonomies

Taxonomies are groups of categories that allow to classify and cluster the principal Implementation Plan entities (see above)

Learn more: [for visitors (3.3)](visitors/categories.md) | [for registered users (4.3)](members/categories.md)

#### Sources


_TODO @dmprk: provide icon_

Sources allow classifying **Recommendations** by their type of origin.

> Categorises: Recommendations

---

#### Thematic Clusters

![](assets/clusters.png)

Thematic Clusters are groups of **Objectives** that make the National Implementation Plan more manageable. For instance, if **Objectives** were received on the same topic from the UPR and CRC Committee they can be put into one thematic cluster and dealt with together, eliminating duplication and taking a coordinated approach to implementation across multiple frameworks

> Categorises:
> * Recommendations
> * SDS Strategic Outcomes
> * SDG Targets
> * Actions

---

#### Human Rights Bodies

![](assets/1_humanRightsBody.png)

Human Rights Bodies, incl. Treaty bodies, refer to the Committees which issue recommendations to States on how to meet their human rights obligations. This taxonomy also includes the Universal Periodic Review and Special Procedures. For each human rights body, one or more **Reporting cycles** (see below) are defined through which recommendations are also linked with the relevant human rights body.

> Categorises: Recommendations
>
> _(via Reporting cycles)_

---

#### Reporting cycles

![](assets/2_UNsession.png)

Each **Human Rights Body** Committee reviews the State on a regular basis. The cycle allows users of the application to easily see which cycle the recommendations relate to. In addition to the periodic cycles this taxonomy also includes non-periodic and static categories for each **Human Rights Body" such as the treaty body articles and treaty body general recommendations.

> Categorises: Recommendations

---


#### SDS Priority Areas

_TODO @tmfrnz: add icon (same as SDS Strategic Outcomes)_

The different Priority Areas of the SDS that each contain one or more **SDS Key Outcomes** that in turn contain one or more **SDS Strategic Outcomes** that are regarded as objectives of the SDS framework. Through the key outcomes, the priority areas are linked to the strategic outcomes and also HR recommendations.

> Categorises:
> * SDS Strategic Outcomes
> * Recommendations
>
> _(via SDS Key Outcomes)_

---

#### SDS Key Outcomes

_TODO @tmfrnz: add icon (same as SDS Strategic Outcomes)_

The SDS Key Outcomes group the **SDS Strategic Outcomes** as the objectives of the SDS framework. In addition, to capture relevant cross-framework linkages, HR recommendations can also be tagged with one or more key outcomes.

> Categorises:
> * SDS Strategic Outcomes
> * Recommendations

---

#### Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)

![](assets/7_sdgs.png)

The Sustainable Development Goals is a set of 17 global goals covering a broad range of sustainable development issues and that group the 169 **SDG targets**. In addition, to capture relevant cross-framework linkages, HR recommendations can also be tagged with one or more SDGs.

> Categorises:
> * SDG Targets
> * Recommendations

---

#### Human Rights Issues

![](assets/3_humanRight.png)

The application contains a list of human rights issues which are used to tag **Recommendations** and **Actions**

> Categorises:
> * Recommendations
> * Actions

---

#### Affected persons

![](assets/4_affectedPersons.png)

The application contains a list of groups of persons which are used to tag **Recommendations** and **Actions**

> Categorises:
> * Recommendations
> * Actions

---

#### Organisations, incl Government Agencies

![](assets/6_organisation.png)

The application contains a list of organisations, mainly Government agencies, which are used to tag **Actions**

> Categorises: Actions

---

#### Progress status

_TODO @dmprk: provide icon_

A simple taxonomy to capture the progress status of **Actions** and allow marking them as complete.

> Categorises: Actions
