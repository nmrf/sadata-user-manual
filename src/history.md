## 1.2 History

[IMPACT OSS ↗](http://impactoss.org/) was designed and developed by human rights consultant [Mr. Ashley Bowe ↗](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-bowe-a4716019/) and data visualisation agency [Unfold Data ↗](http://unfolddata.com/) with the help of Mr. Moana Eruera of the [New Zealand Human Rights Commission ↗](https://www.hrc.co.nz/) \(HRC\) who together would later form the [Impact Open Source Software Trust ↗](https://impactoss.org) with the mission of advancing the enjoyment of human rights and sustainable development by promoting and developing suitable open source technologies.

### Initial concept

The initial concept for the software that became [IMPACT OSS ↗](https://impactoss.org/impactoss), the open source software behind Sadata, was developed by [Mr. Ashley Bowe ↗](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-bowe-a4716019/) who was subsequently employed by the Regional Office for the Pacific \(ROP\) of the [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ↗](http://www.ohchr.org/) to fundraise and project manage the development of the software.

### Development of Sadata version 1 (released in August 2017)

The [United Nations Development Program in Samoa ↗](http://www.ws.undp.org/) and [New Zealand Aid ↗](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/aid-and-development/) generously provided the required resources, allowing to contract New Zealand based data visualisation agency [Unfold Data ↗](http://unfolddata.com/) for the design and development of Sadata, as well as refining its functional and technical concept. Further, having previously developed the Human Rights National Plan of Action for the [New Zealand Human Rights Commission ↗](https://www.hrc.co.nz) to assist with its UPR reporting obligations, they were also able to consider New Zealand's specific requirements from the start, ultimately allowing [IMPACT OSS ↗](http://impactoss.org/impactoss) to be compatible with and adaptable to the specific needs of different countries.

This also allowed the [New Zealand HRC ↗](https://www.hrc.co.nz/) to become the final partner in the creation of [IMPACT OSS ↗](http://impactoss.org/impactoss), initially providing in-kind support and later funding the development of the Sustainable Development Goal module and other features.

[IMPACT OSS ↗](https://impactoss.org) was thus born in Samoa and New Zealand and is now currently being used as the software platform for [Sadata ↗](https://sadata-staging.firebaseapp.com/actions) in Samoa and the [New Zealand NPA ↗](http://npa.hrc.co.nz). From the outset it was decided that this innovative software would be released under an open source license - a Pacific global offering to improve implementation and reporting of human rights and the SDGs around the world.

### Development of Sadata version 2 (released in June 2021)

To allow the integration of Samoa's national objectives as specified in its [Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS) ↗](https://www.mof.gov.ws/services/aid-coordination-debt-management/strategy-for-the-development-of-samoa), the [Pacific Community’s (SPC) Human Rights and Social Development Division ↗](https://www.spc.int/human-rights-and-social-development-hrsd) contracted the [Impact OSS Trust ↗](https://impactoss.org) for the concept and development of an enhanced version of Sadata, that also incorporates the latest developments of IMPACT OSS funded by the NZ Human Rights Commission.
