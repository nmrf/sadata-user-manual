### 3.7 Register

Visitors may want to become Users at some point, in order to upload a report/date for a particular indicator within the National Implementation Plan. E.g. an NGO who has conducted a human rights training program on the rights of person with disabilities would like it recorded in the National Plan.

See [Register](/visitors/becoming-a-user.md "How to: Register")
